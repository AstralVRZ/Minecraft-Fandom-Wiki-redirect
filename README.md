# Minecraft-Fandom-Wiki-redirect
Little user script that redirects from minecraft.fandom.com (bad 👎) to minecraft.wiki (good 👍)

I've never done Javascript, so let's see how this works out!

I personally use [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) to run this script.

# Todo list
- [x] Make it take article paths and redirect to the proper ones
- [x] Make into gist
